### Things to do ###
* What goes in 
    - medication form
    - personal issues => kinda did
    - hobbies
* Pair mentee, mentor randomly => doing
* Put character limits in
* instead of flashing to home page for mentor out of London, redirect to another page, and then have button for home?
* Refactor => make code more concise. 
    - A lot of the stuff are repeated b/c of mentor/mentee, w/ only difference being 
whether it says mentor or mentee, and the if statement ==> define separate functions?
* Improve quality code
    - Make code less vulnerable to errors
    - Sometimes variables called with possibility of them not being defined (bc created in if loops)
    - When to pass mentee/mentor and user? 
* Should we have the personal form after the general signup? (name, last name, email)
it could make testing more specific, and the form.validate_on_submit
------------------------------------------------------------
To Do Before Move On:
~~* Filter by paired status~~
~~* Signup linked to school database - if school_id isn't saved in database --> validators.py~~
* Make only 'id' for own table id's
* Filter by admin approval
* Sort out 'auth' folder 
* Admin search

To Discuss:
* What happens after mentor books meeting, for mentee confirmation:
    1. views all booked meetings (in a table or smth), and one that needs confirmation is highlighted, then they click it
