### Things to do ###
* What goes in 
    - medication form
    - personal issues => kinda did
    - hobbies
~~* Pair mentee, mentor randomly => doing~~
* Put character limits in
* Refactor => make code more concise. 
    - A lot of the stuff are repeated b/c of mentor/mentee, w/ only difference being 
whether it says mentor or mentee, and the if statement ==> define separate functions?
* Improve quality code
    - Make code less vulnerable to errors
    - Sometimes variables called with possibility of them not being defined (bc created in if loops)
    - When to pass mentee/mentor and user? 
* Should we have the personal form after the general signup? (name, last name, email)
it could make testing more specific, and the form.validate_on_submit
------------------------------------------------------------
To Do Before Move On:
~~* Filter by paired status~~
~~* Signup linked to school database - if school_id isn't saved in database --> validators.py~~
* Make only 'id' for own table id's
~~* Filter by admin approval when pairing~~ 
* Error handling
~~* Fix email in column~~
* Sort out 'auth' folder 
* Mentee/Mentor view meetings
~~* Admin search~~
~~* Fix home page signup, let schools sign up
~~* Let mentors sign up on home page~~
~~* Fix inactive user thingy~~
~~* Let admin approve schools~~
~~* Make personal form check for if school is active as well~~
~~* Make location form check if a mentor is approved~~  
* Finish refactoring code
~~* Control panel, need to fix email column. need to pass user~~
* Redo testing
* Fix HTML
* Selenium web testing thingy 
----------------------------------------------------------
