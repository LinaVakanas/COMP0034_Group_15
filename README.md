###Group 15 COMP0034###

Database is set up by running the db_setup.py (outside the app folder), which creates the SQLite database. The default 
required column (school0, user0 and admin) are created . If a populated database is required (for better testing), the populate_db.py 
can be run by un-commenting its execution in the __ innit__.py file.
