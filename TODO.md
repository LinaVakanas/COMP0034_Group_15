### Things to do ###
* What goes in 
    - medication form
    - personal issues => kinda did
    - hobbies
* Pair mentee, mentor randomly => doing
* Put character limits in
* instead of flashing to home page for mentor out of London, redirect to another page, and then have button for home?
* Refactor => make code more concise. 
    - A lot of the stuff are repeated b/c of mentor/mentee, w/ only difference being 
whether it says mentor or mentee, and the if statement ==> define separate functions?
* Improve quality code
    - Make code less vulnerable to errors
    - Sometimes variables called with possibility of them not being defined (bc created in if loops)
    - When to pass mentee/mentor and user? 
* Should we have the personal form after the general signup? (name, last name, email)
it could make testing more specific, and the form.validate_on_submit
